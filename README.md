## **Problem 1:**

### *Standardized path problem*
  
  This problem was asked by Quora.

## **Problem 2:**

###  Encoding & Decoding 

  This problem was asked by Amazon. Run-length encoding is a fast and simple method of encoding strings. The basic idea is to represent 
repeated successive characters as a single count and character. For example, the string AAAABBBCCDAA would
be encoded as 4A3B2C1D2A.

Implement run-length encoding and decoding.
You can assume the string to be encoded have no digits and consists solely of alphabetic characters.
You can assume the string to be decoded is valid.
